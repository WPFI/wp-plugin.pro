# Multilingual WordPress
WordPress doesn't support multiple languages out of the box, but making it multilingual is pretty easy.

## Do
Use Polylang.

## Avoid
Legacy multilingual plugins such as qTranslate (X), WPML, and others.

## Do not
Create a multisite for multilinguality. Even if [WordPress codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Multilingual_WordPress) tells you that there are plugins for that, using a multisite for multiple languages is about the worst possible idea anyone could come up with related to this topic. It may sound simple to implement, but in reality it's nothing but.
