# WTF is this about?
Last time I checked, the WordPress plugin repository contained 54,659 plugins. The good ones drown in the noise, and the bad ones get love because they're popular or were the only solution in the past.

**Example**: Yoast. For many years it was _the_ SEO plugin. Then it started adding useless features and bloating the interface. There are better solutions out there, but human is a creature of habit. Same goes for Contact Form 7, WPML, WP Super Cache, NextGEN Gallery, the list is endless.

Professional developers have experienced the problems first hand, and know what to use, and what not to use. Every developer will come up with a trick or two every once in a while, this is a place to share that knowledge. If you can write Markdown (it's easy!), and have a GitHub account, you can participate. [Contributions are very welcome.](https://github.com/k1sul1/wp-plugin.pro)

## Know things? 
If those thing relate to WordPress even remotely they're probably fit for this site. Mind sharing?
Comparisons of things in category X (SEO, custom fields, etc.), codesnippets (hint: new language features, code re-use, etc.), but really just about anything that could be helpful to someone. 

If you have 10 minutes to kill and knowledge to share: [https://github.com/k1sul1/wp-plugin.pro](https://github.com/k1sul1/wp-plugin.pro)

Navigate to `src/pages/`. Any folders you create or markdown files you add are literally 3 clicks away from being published.
